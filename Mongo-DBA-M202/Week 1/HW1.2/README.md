<div><p>You are operating a geographically dispersed replica set as outlined below:</p><img width="400" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/edu-static.mongodb.com/lessons/m202/chapter+2/replica_set_chaining.png"><br><p>Your network operations team has asked if you can limit the amount of outbound traffic from Site A because of some capacity issues with the traffic in and out of that site. For example, consider that this is where the majority of your users stream/download. However, due to how the application is deployed, you wish to keep your write traffic in Site A for performance, and so you have chosen not to change which server is primary.</p><p>Using replica set chaining, which of the following scenarios will minimize traffic due to MongoDB replication in and out of Site A?</p><p><i>Note: It will probably help you to draw each of the choices below for yourself as you think through them.</i></p></div>
