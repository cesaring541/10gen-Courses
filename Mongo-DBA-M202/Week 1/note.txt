Lecture Notes

First download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox.

Then download this lesson's handout and extract it. It contains a directory which contains a README and a Vagrantfile in it.

Open a shell and cd to the extracted directory. Run vagrant up. Vagrant always looks for a Vagrantfile in your current directory to determine which VM image and configuration to use. It will take a while for Vagrant to download the image, but Vagrant caches VM images locally, so you will only need to wait for this download once.

Once the download finishes the VM will boot up and display a standard Ubuntu desktop that has MongoDB, MongoProc, and other tools used in this course pre-installed.

Also, the following has changed since the video was filmed:

    The directory name is now M202Vagrant.
    The default box is now named 'm202-ubuntu1404'.
    The size of the box is roughly 1.0 GB.
    The version of ubuntu used is now 14.04.
    The username/password is now 'm202 User'/'m202' (no quotes)
    The version of mongodb being used is now 2.6.4.
