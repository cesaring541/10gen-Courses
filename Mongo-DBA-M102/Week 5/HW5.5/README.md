You want to reconfigure your replica set config to exclude the primary, and allow your secondary to be elected, but you run into trouble. Find out the optional parameter that you'll need, and input it into the box below for your rs.reconfigure(new_cfg, OPTIONAL PARAMETER).</p><p><em>Hint: You may want to use <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/reconfigure-replica-set-with-unavailable-members/">this documentation page</a> to solve this problem.</em></p><p>Your answer should be of the form { key : value } (including brackets). </p></div>
